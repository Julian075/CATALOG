# CATALOG

CATALOG is an implementation of multiple machine learning models and training strategies for multi-modal feature extraction and classification tasks. The repository focuses on datasets such as **Snapshot Serengeti** and **Terra Incognita**, providing baseline models, fine-tuning techniques, and feature projection methods. 

## Features
- **Baseline Models**: Includes standard feature extraction and classification techniques.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Optimized models with domain-specific adjustments.
- **Multi-modal Feature Projections**: Integration of image and textual features.
- **Support for Long Features**: Extended capabilities for long-sequence feature analysis.

## Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- CLIP by OpenAI
- Additional libraries: `Pillow`, `argparse`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
